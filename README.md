## Files

### 01-rock-paper-scissors.html

This file contains the basic implementation of the Rock/Paper/Scissors game. It allows users to choose between rock, paper, or scissors by clicking buttons. The computer randomly selects its move, and the result of the game is displayed in an alert box.

### 02-rock paper-function.html

This file enhances the game by using functions to handle the game logic. The `playGame` function takes the user's move as an argument and determines the result based on the computer's randomly selected move, which is generated by the `pickComputerMove` function. The result is also displayed in an alert box.
